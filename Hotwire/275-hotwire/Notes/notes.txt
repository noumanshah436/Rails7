Hotwire is a web development framework and set of tools designed to make building modern web applications faster and more efficient.
It is often associated with Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework, as it was created by the same team.

Hotwire includes several components:

1. **Turbo:**
Turbo  speeds up the application by taking sections of your application and just re-redering just one section instead of doing a full page refresh.
With turbo you can also broadcast updates so that anyone who is subscribed to a particular channel will also receive those updates.
Turbo is a set of JavaScript libraries that work with your existing server-rendered HTML.
It allows you to enhance the user experience by sending HTML updates from the server, without needing to build a single-page application (SPA).
This can make your web applications more interactive without the complexity of full SPAs.

2. **Stimulus:**
Stimulus is a JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to your HTML using a simple and conventional approach.
It helps you create interactive elements on your web pages without the need for a complex JavaScript framework.

3. **Strada:**
Strada is a server-side component of Hotwire. It helps manage the communication between your client and server, making it possible to send HTML updates efficiently.

Hotwire aims to simplify the development of web applications by combining server-rendered HTML with modern JavaScript techniques, providing a balance between rich user experiences and development simplicity. It's particularly valuable for developers who prefer traditional server-side rendering but still want to add real-time or interactive features to their applications.


*************************************

Turbo frame isolates the sections of your view and when you intract with it you can just replace just one section of the view.
