Live streams
One of the benifit of turbo streams is you can update the page via WebSockets.

This means you can open up a WebSocket connection in your browser, and then you can send data through that connection from anywhere in your application.

So let's set it up and try it.

I'll add a new POST route named fourth which we'll trigger using our button, and inside the fourth action,
 we can use the Turbo::StreamsChannel module to send Turbo Stream messages over the WebSocket connection.

# app/controllers/site_controller.rb
def fourth
  Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_update_to("mystr", target: "content", partial: "site/the_stuff")
end


So let's just broadcast updates, as we did before. We'll update the content div through the mystr stream.
