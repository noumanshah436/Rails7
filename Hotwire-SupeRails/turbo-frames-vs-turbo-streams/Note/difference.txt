In terms of how easy they are to implement, Turbo Frames win because there's not that much you have to do.
You just wrap sections in frames, and you're done.

But updating multiple sections at the same time is only supported by Turbo Streams.
Which also has WebSocket support, and it can do a lot more than just updates.

On the other hand, Turbo Frames are also suitable for progressively loading frames when a particular section of the page becomes visible.

Caching is another benefit that Turbo Frames bring to the table because it allows you to split a page up into multiple smaller page segments, each of which can be cached independently of the others.
