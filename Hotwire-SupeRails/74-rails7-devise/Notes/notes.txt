*********************************

Basic idea:

Since Turbolinks is replaced with Turbo Drive (That is part of Hotwire) in rails 7, we need to ensure full-page redirects when submitting devise forms.
To do so, add data: { turbo: false } on all devise forms, after you run rails generate devise:views.
